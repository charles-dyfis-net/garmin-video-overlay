Back in the day, I was an e-bike enthusiast, and wanted to help a fellow cyclist mark up their ride videos with a data feed from a Garmin GPS device. This tool uses Genshi to modify a SVG file for each frame to generate a dashboard based on data from a data feed using data in the formats described by the http://www.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrainingCenterDatabase/v2 and http://www.garmin.com/xmlschemas/ActivityExtension/v2 schemas; and overlays that dashboard onto a GStreamer video feed.
